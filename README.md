== README

## Bloccit: a Reddit replica to teach the fundamentals of web development and Rails. Made with my mentor Elad Meidar at [Bloc](http://bloc.io).

I've deployed this on Heroku as viral-bloccit, which you can view here [viral-bloccit](https://viral-bloccit.herokuapp.com/)

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...


Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
